## [ELIMINATE_GIFS](http://reddit.com/u/ELIMINATE_GIFS)

a reddit bot that finds GIFs in comments and replies with an HTML5 video of the GIF. 

The bot uses AWS S3 for storage and AWS Elastic Transcoder for conversion, as well as my URL Shortener/simple analytics service [nu.cm](http://nu.cm). 

The HTML5 videos are served with a simple PHP script which also implements oEmbed.

### usage 

if you want to run this, you will need to go through and change some credentials, bucket names, and so on.

The bot is merely a novelty; it is not a feasible concept, nor very useful.
